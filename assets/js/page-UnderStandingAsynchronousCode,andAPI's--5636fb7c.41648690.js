By saying it executes in a predictable order, I mean that you could predict the exact order your code wil be executed in response to specified actions by the user. For example, you know the exact path an event will take. A button will execute a function in your controller, which will route to your service, which will make a change to your data, which will trigger a draw function in your controller. If the user were to click another button before the first one was finished executing, JavaScript would wait until it had finished the first button's many code blocks before executing any code from the second button. **Asynchronous code does** ***not*** execute in a predictable order**, and does not have to be contained within the browser. Asynchronous code is most often used to communicate with entities outside of your browser, such as API's. Since these entities are outside of your browser, JavaScript cannot know when they will finish communicating with you, or if they will even respond. Because of this, we need to write code that can handle unpredictable behavior. If an API takes several seconds to respond, a fully synchronous program would leave the user waiting for tasks that could be completed in the meantime.\n")])]),e._v(" "),s("div",{staticClass:"line-numbers-wrapper"},[s("span",{staticClass:"line-number"},[e._v("1")]),s("br")])]),s("p",[s("strong",[e._v("2.")]),e._v(" What is an event listener?\n")]),e._v(" "),s("div",{staticClass:"language- line-numbers-mode"},[s("pre",{pre:!0,attrs:{class:"language-text"}},[s("code",[e._v("An event listener is named quite literally; an event listener listens for events.
