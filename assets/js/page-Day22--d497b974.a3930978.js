For example, if you expect one side of your relationships to have relatively few relationships, it may make sense to store foreign keys within that document. For example, you may have a many-to-many relationship between contractors and houses. One house is likely to have a limited number of contractors associated with it, but a contractor may easily have hundreds of past jobs. This relationship is still many-to-many, but is severely lopsided. Listing foreign contractor keys on your house document may be an effective way to represent this relationship. The number of contractors per house may vary, but it's safe to say that the list should take up a managable amount of space.")])])}),[],!1,null,null,null);t.default=s.exports}}]);
