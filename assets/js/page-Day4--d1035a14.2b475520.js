Low fidelity wire-frames should be easier to create and take less time, and they will leave more room for decision making further down the road of development. High fidelity wire-frames give a much more precise and specific picture of the end-goal for developing a website. They may specify what types of content go where, exactly how parts of the webpage function, and break down the page to just about every element. High fidelity wire-frames will be more time-consuming than low fidelity wire-frames, just because more detail needs to be added, and more decisions need to be made. High fidelity wire-frames can be useful for more complex web pages, where using a wire-frame as a reference will expedite the work of development.
